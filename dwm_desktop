As root create a file like this:

$ cat /usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=dwm
Comment=Dynamic window manager
Exec=dwm
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession
with these permissions

$ ls -l /usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 108 Jun 27 17:24 /usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop

Optionally rather than executing dwm directly you could execute a shell script instead that writes stdout / stderr to a file for logging purposes.

E.g.

Exec=startdwm
and

$ cat /usr/local/bin/startdwm
#!/bin/sh
echo "$(date): Starting dwn" >> /path/to/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H.dwm.log)
dwm >> /path/to/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H.dwm.log) 2>&1

$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/startdwm
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 204 Sep 19 14:12 /usr/local/bin/startdwm

If you use that then despite the uncool name the cool_autostart patch works pretty well.

If you usually use xinit to launch dwm and would like to do that with your other window managers, make your xinit a script that allows you to specify your window manager. Here's my xinitrc:

session=${1:-dwm}

xrdb ~/.Xresources
case $session in
    dwm    ) exec dwm;;
    bspwm  ) exec bspwm;;
    xmonad ) exec xmonad;;
    i3     ) exec i3;;
    *      ) exec $1;;
esac

You can then launch whatever you want with startx ~/.xinitrc <insert wm>. I recommend you put a couple aliases for that in your bashrc or zshrc.
